# Identity to secure ASAFARIM Web API backend for all our frontend Single Page Applications (SPAs)

ASP.NET Core Identity provides APIs that handle authentication, authorization, and identity management. The APIs make it possible to secure endpoints of a Web API backend with cookie-based authentication. A token-based option is available for clients that can't use cookies, but in using this you are responsible for ensuring the tokens are kept secure. We recommend using cookies for browser-based applications, because, by default, the browser automatically handles them without exposing them to JavaScript.
